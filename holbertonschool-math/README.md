#Complex numbers

Complex numbers are expressions of the form x + yi, where x and y are real numbers, and
i is a new symbol. Multiplication of complex numbers will eventually be defined so that
i
2 = −1. (Electrical engineers sometimes write j instead of i, because they want to reserve i
for current, but everybody else thinks that’s weird.) Just as the set of all real numbers is
denoted R, the set of all complex numbers is denoted C.
